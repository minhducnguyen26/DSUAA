## I. Why this web application?
From January 2020 to April 2021, I worked as a Student Assistant for the Student Affairs and the Academic Affairs departments at Dixie State University. In the office, we had snacks, coffees, and teas for all of the staff members, students, and visitors. Part of my responsibilities was to taking care of the inventory of all the items we had, including checking and restocking them daily, as well as informing my supervisor if we needed to purchase more items. 

For a long time, when I needed to let my supervisor know what items we need to buy, I would go around and write the name and the amount of the items on a post-it note or a piece of paper and give it to her. She would then bring that note to the store to buy the items. After doing that for so many times repeatedly, I was like: "There has to be a better way to do all of this." Because of that, I decided to build this web application.

## II. How does it work?
I designed this web application to perform best for a team of two or more people. In this web app, there are three pages and each one of them holds a specific roles and for a specific person: 

  * **ITEMS** page (for Student Assistant): This is where I get all of the snacks, coffees, and teas we have in the office from a database and display it as a table. In this page, I can search, add, edit, and remove any item and all of the changes will be saved to the database.

   <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
   * **CART** page (for Student Assistant): In this page, all of the items are displayed by there images to help with finding and adding the correct items to the cart. In the same page, I can open the cart and see all of the items I added and an estimate total. The purporse of the estimate cost is so that we could keep track of our budget so we can add or remove any item if needed. Then, I can change the quantity of the items, if desired, and all of the information inside the cart will be saved to another database.

   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   
   * **TO BUY LIST** page (for supervisor): Instead of having a post-it note, my supervisor can come to this page and she can see of the items she needs to get, as well as the price and the location (where she needs to get it from) of each of the items. This information is retrieved from the same database with the Cart page. After buying an item, my supervisor can cross it out or delete it, or she can delete all of the items once she gets everything. Again, all of the changes will be updated to the database.
